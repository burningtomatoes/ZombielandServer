# ZombielandServer
One game a week challenge: A very small zombie survival "MMO".
This is the server that goes with the client.

Building
---
Uses Node.js, you will need the following dependencies:
- `socket.io`
- `chance`
- `node-static`
- `request`

(And possibly more I've forgot, but you'll figure it out)

Run with `node server.js`.
